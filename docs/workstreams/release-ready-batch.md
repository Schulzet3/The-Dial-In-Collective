# READY batch certification journal

## November 2, 2026 — Automatic READY batch combined-source CI (non-publishing)

Owner directed automatic READY certification to eliminate repeated manual release preparation. Added a development-branch push/dispatch workflow that validates the exact queue schema, intake and strict source-to-published coverage, then executes combined Node, cloud/offline/UI, lint and build checks. Workflow is non-publishing, has read-only contents permission, does not create a grant, and explicitly leaves offsite recovery/provider checks to release preflight. This is an implementation awaiting actual hosted workflow execution; no tests are claimed PASSED by this commit. Source parent 64e923b35e62100d05dae0f302cf78d5f3a16068; no production write or deploy.
